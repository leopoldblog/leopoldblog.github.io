# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** ðŸ‘‹,`<br>`

Hi there, thanks for visiting my website! I am a junior at Xi'an Jiaotong University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I'm looking for Ph.D. positions starting in 25Fall.

I am interested in reasoning in natural language processing and how to evaluate and improve the knowledge ability of large language models to better address real-world problems. I'm a member of [LUD lab](https://luoundergradxjtu.github.io/), the premiere undergraduate research group @ XJTU, advised by Prof. [Minnan Luo](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/minnluo). I have interned at UW NLP with Ph.D. student [Shangbin Feng](https://bunsenfeng.github.io/) and Prof. [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/). I am now visiting at the University of Notre dame, working with Ph.D. student [Qingkai Zeng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7qiPINEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Zhaoxuan Tan](https://zhaoxuan.info/) and Prof. [Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/). My previous research includes social network analysis and knowledge graphs.
